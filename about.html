        <p class="firstparagraph">&emsp;Google is one of the world’s leading technology companies, 
          founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while 
          they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. The duo 
          developed a search engine called "Backrub," which utilized a 
          novel ranking algorithm called PageRank to prioritize web 
          pages based on their relevance and authority. Renamed 
          Google—a play on the mathematical term "googol" (1 followed 
          by 100 zeros)—the search engine aimed to "organize the 
          world’s information and make it universally accessible and 
          useful." Google's initial success came from its clean 
          interface and superior search results, quickly surpassing 
          competitors. The company’s 2004 IPO marked its rise to one of 
          the most influential tech giants, and its mission expanded 
          beyond search to encompass various digital products and services.

          &emsp;Over the years, Google diversified its offerings, including Gmail 
          (2004), Google Maps (2005), YouTube (acquired in 2006), and 
          Android (acquired in 2005), which became the world’s most popular 
          mobile operating system. It pioneered innovations in advertising 
          with Google Ads, which became its primary revenue stream. In 2015, 
          Google restructured under the parent company Alphabet Inc., 
          reflecting its ventures into fields like artificial intelligence, 
          self-driving cars, and healthcare. Despite its dominance, Google 
          has faced controversies over data privacy, antitrust concerns, and 
          its influence over digital ecosystems. Today, it remains a 
          cornerstone of the internet, shaping how billions access and 
          interact with information.
