This is a project for the subject: Introduction to Computing. The goal is to write a website from scratch with Cascading Style Sheet design and interactive elements.

As you can see, the website looks quite simiilar to Google's website. That is because it is what I intended to copy.
Coming up with a unique idea and design is difficult and requires massive amounts of brain power which I currently do not possess.
